# MY HYPRLAND RICE
This rice uses configs from many repos, so it's not 100% pure my creation

I use Matugen as the color scheme generator, so this dotfiles will work better with Matugen as you don't have to reconfigure every colors in the config file

As for the wallpaper, i use swww. The wallpaper picker script that i made uses swww combined with Matugen, so you need to tweak the script a bit to work with your own system if you use a different wallpaper backend

Special credit to [JaKooLit](https://github.com/JaKooLit), i used some of his scripts and waybar settings
